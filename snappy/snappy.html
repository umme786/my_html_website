                     <h2> <span> 1 </span> PRELIMINARY DISCOVERY </h2>
                     <p> We start a conversation. What are your goals? What challenges are you facing? How could a program potentially help you? What would your ideal program look like? By answering questions like these early, we can discern whether taking additional steps will be worthwhile. </p>
                     <h2> <span> 2 </span> DISCOVERY </h2>
                     <p> During this phase, we spend as little as one day or as much as two weeks working with your team to inventory all the tools and resources you have available. </p>
                     <h2> <span> 3 </span> SCOPE OF WORK </h2>
                     <p> Using information gathered during the Discovery process, a comprehensive Scope of Work is prepared. This Scope of Work details each deliverable and the number of hours that will be required to make your program a success. It also includes complete pricing. </p>
                     <h2> <span> 4 </span>SCHEDULING </h2>
                     <p> Once the Scope of Work is approved, each element is scheduled and added to a project management timeline. Individual roles, responsibilities, and benchmarks are defined. </p>
                     <h2> <span> 5 </span> KICK˜OFF </h2>
                     <p> All individuals involved in the project meet to review the schedule and assigned work. Expectations are discussed and group buy-in is achieved.</p>

                     <p> Our team of writers conducts interviews with key people from your organization, performs intensive research, and ultimately prepares the written copy that will eventually become presentations, white papers, emails, videos, and other tools. </p>
                     <h2> <span> 7 </span> DESIGN, PHOTOGRAPHY & FILMING </h2>
                     <p> Even great copy is worthless without the right method of delivery. During this phase, all the great messaging that has been prepared is converted into infographics, slides, widgets, videos and other deliverables as defined in the Scope of Work. </p>
                     <h2> <span> 8 </span> EDITING & COMPLIANCE </h2>
                     <p> We understand what regulators require and our work usually needs minimal revisions – but there are always some. This is the phase where we make sure everything meets compliance requirements. </p>
